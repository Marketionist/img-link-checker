Check any file for broken links and images. The script in this package parses any file that you specify and checks all
absolute links in it. It makes request to URL specified in each link and if response status code is not 200 (OK) then
the process exits and the list of broken links is outputted. 

# Installation
This is a lightweight package with only 1 dependency (axios). To install it just run:
```
npm install img-link-checker --save-dev
```

# Usage

## From the code
For example if you want to check `README.md` for broken links and images just require `img-link-checker` and call
`checkFile('./path/to/file/', 'README.md');`:
```
const { checkFile } = require('img-link-checker');

checkFile('./README.md');
```

## From the command line
Checking for broken links and images can also be invoked directly from the command line - just install the package and
launch the command with `TARGET_FILE_PATH` environment variable:
```
TARGET_FILE_PATH='./README.md' node node_modules/.bin/img-link-checker
```
